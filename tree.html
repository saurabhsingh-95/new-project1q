                    Distinctive Growth:
                    Banyan trees are known for their aerial roots that grow downwards from the branches,
                    eventually rooting in the ground to become new trunks, allowing the tree to spread extensively.
                    Size and Longevity:
                    They are among the largest trees in the world, with canopies that can spread over vast areas, and
                    they are known for their remarkable longevity,
                    with some specimens living for centuries.
                    Cultural and Religious Significance:
                    The Banyan tree holds significant cultural and religious importance in various societies,
                    particularly in India, where it is considered sacred and is often referred to as the "Tree of Life".

                <p class="peragraph">
                    The Great Banyan is a banyan tree (Ficus benghalensis) located in Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose
                    Indian Botanic Garden, Shibpur, Howrah, near Kolkata, India.
                    [1] The great banyan tree draws more visitors to the garden than its collection of exotic plants
                    from five continents.
                    Its main trunk became infected by fungi after it was struck by two cyclones. In 1925, the main trunk
                    was removed to keep the remainder of the tree healthy.
                    A 330-metre-long (1,080 ft) road was built around its circumference,
                    It was recorded to be the largest tree specimen in the world in the Guinness Book of World
                    Records in 1989.

                    There are more than 60,000 species of trees in the world,
                    all as wildly different and unique as human beings. Sadly,
                    some of the most marvelous ones to admire are also the same ones threatened by deforestation,
                    agricultural expansion, and an ever-changing climate.
                    Of the 20,000-some tree species included on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red
                    List,
                    more than 8,000 are critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable to extinction.
